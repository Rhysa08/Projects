            <ol type="I">
                <li>Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, England.
                Educational Prodigy:</li>
                
                <li>Turing showed early signs of mathematical genius and attended King's College, Cambridge, in 1931.
                </li>
                
                <li>Turing's 1936 paper, "On Computable Numbers," laid the theoretical groundwork for modern computing and introduced the concept of the Turing machine.
                </li>
                
                <li>During World War II, Turing played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code at Bletchley Park, contributing significantly to Allied intelligence.
                </li>
                
                <li>Turing designed the Bombe, an electromechanical device used to decipher Enigma-encrypted messages, a key factor in the Allied victory.
                </li>
                
                <li>Turing worked on the development of the Manchester Mark 1, one of the earliest stored-program computers, at the University of Manchester.
                </li>
                
                <li>Turing's 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," introduced the famous "Turing Test" to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.
                </li>
                
                <li>In 1952, Turing was arrested and convicted of "gross indecency" for his homosexuality, leading to chemical castration.
                </li>
                
                <li>Alan Turing died on June 7, 1954, at the age of 41, in what was officially ruled as suicide. The circumstances of his death remain a subject of historical interest and debate.
                </li>
                
                <li>Turing received posthumous recognition for his contributions to science and mathematics, including a royal pardon in 2013 and the "Alan Turing law" in 2017, which posthumously pardoned men convicted under historical anti-homosexuality laws.
                </li>
                
                <li>Turing's concepts and theories have become fundamental to the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence, influencing the development of modern computers and shaping the digital age.
                </li>
                
                <li>The Turing Award, named in his honor, is one of the highest honors in computer science, recognizing individuals for their contributions to the computing community.</li>
