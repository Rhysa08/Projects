# Projects

Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

ðŸ¦¦ This is a collection of a bunch of projects I have completed academically and personally. Many of my projects, however, are lost to time or locked up due to it being previous academic work. Nevertheless, this compendium of projects demonstrates many of the foundational skills I have learnt and applied.

 ðŸ˜¾: P.S.: I am currently working on a personal project that I won't share publicly for now, when it's in a more complete state, I'll add it to a seperate repository as I intend on continuing to develop it further and it doesn't really belong with these relics ðŸ˜….

 ðŸ™€:P.P.S: Every project on here except the "To-Do list" is a project I have worked on as part of my coursework in my degree. So, if you're wondering why they are so boring, that'll be why ðŸ˜†.
